## Intructions
1. Go to data/editable.js and click on Edit This File (the pencil icon).
2. Once there, scroll to the bottom, and copypaste the latest entry in the file, adding a new one.
3. IMPORTANT: You must include the { } ! Also note that every entry except the last one you are adding must be separated by a comma. It's okay to not do it right, though. I'll fix it before porting it to the final code.
4. Make any changes to the entries as you see fit, remembering to increase the id number to account for the new entry and keeping all text strings inside of "". You can always use the previous entries as references when unsure.
5. Once done, click the green Commit Changes button. I'll check later and make the new entries permament.
